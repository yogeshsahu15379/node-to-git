# AES Web Components Repository

## The AES Design System as reusable, easily-applied code snippets and examples.

All rules, documentation, and reusable components of the AES Design System are found right here in Storybook!

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context. That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as stories to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

All pieces of the AES Design System are designed and built according to
Component Driven Interfaces, with heavy influence from Atomic Design. Check
out Design Tokens like Colors or Spacings, or Atoms components like The Line
(make sure you interact with the Controls panel to dynamically change these
in the UI!)
